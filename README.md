# Virus Simulator

Interactive simulation for the spread of virus.

## Introduction 

The outbreak of the respiratory virus in China has caused an unprecedented global response over the past few months. The spread of a virus can be affected by several factors such as the extent of social distancing and incubation periods of the virus. This project attempts to model the spread of such a virus while impelementing a quadtree data structure to efficiently store data of points on a two-dimensional space.
